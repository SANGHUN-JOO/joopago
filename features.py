Features used by AlphaGo Zero, in approximate order of importance.
Feature                 # Notes
Stone History           16 The stones of each color during the last 8 moves.
Ones                    1  Constant plane of 1s
All features with 8 planes are 1-hot encoded, with plane i marked with 1
only if the feature was equal to i. Any features >= 8 would be marked as 8.

This file includes the features from the first paper as DEFAULT_FEATURES
and the features from AGZ as AGZ_FEATURES.
